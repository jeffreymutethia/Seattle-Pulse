                <p>Seattle Pulse is a hyper-local social media platform focused on Seattle neighborhoods. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your information when you use our mobile app or website.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <h3 className="font-semibold">Data We Collect</h3>
                <p>We collect the information you provide (like your phone number, display name, avatar, neighborhood selection, posts, comments, and direct messages) and some information automatically (like device type, IP address, and basic usage data). We do not collect precise location (no GPS tracking).</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <h3 className="font-semibold">How We Use Data</h3>
                <p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service—for example, to create your account, show posts in your neighborhood feed, send you notifications (like one-time passcodes or updates), moderate content, and display relevant local ads. We may also use data to communicate with you and to ensure safety (like detecting fraud or violations).</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <h3 className="font-semibold">Sharing of Data</h3>
                <p>We do not sell your personal information. At launch, we do not share your data with third-party advertisers or social networks. We may share data with service providers who help us run Seattle Pulse (such as cloud hosting or SMS delivery services) under strict confidentiality. We might also share information if required by law or if we’re ever involved in a merger or similar corporate transaction.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <h3 className="font-semibold">Your Choices</h3>
                <p>You can update your profile info, choose what you post, and adjust notification settings. You can opt out of marketing emails by clicking “unsubscribe.” You can delete your account at any time if you no longer want to use Seattle Pulse.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <h3 className="font-semibold">Your Rights</h3>
                <p>Depending on where you live, you have rights over your data. For example, California and Washington residents (and others, where applicable) can request to access or delete personal information, and European users have GDPR rights. We honor these rights and explain how you can exercise them below.</p>

              <section>
                <h3 className="font-semibold">Cookies &amp; Tracking</h3>
                <p>We use minimal cookies and similar tech to make Seattle Pulse work (e.g., keeping you logged in). We don’t use third-party advertising or social media cookies at launch. We don’t track you across other sites.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <h3 className="font-semibold">Data Security</h3>
                <p>We take security seriously. We use encryption and other safeguards to protect your data. However, no online service is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <h3 className="font-semibold">International Use</h3>
                <p>We store data in the United States. If you use Seattle Pulse from outside the U.S., your data will be transferred to the U.S. We rely on legal measures (like Standard Contractual Clauses) for such transfers when required by law.</p>
              </section>

                <h3 className="font-semibold">Children</h3>
                <p>Seattle Pulse is 13+ only. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn a child under 13 is using the Service, we will delete their information.</p>

              <section>
                <h3 className="font-semibold">Changes to Policy</h3>

            <h2 id="sec1" className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>To provide the Seattle Pulse service, we collect information from and about you in a few different ways:</p>

            <section aria-labelledby="sec1-1">
              <h3 id="sec1-1" className="text-lg font-semibold">1.1. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
              <p>When you use Seattle Pulse, you may give us information:</p>
              <h4 className="font-medium">Account Registration</h4>
              <p>When you sign up, we ask for your mobile phone number or email to create your account and verify your identity via SMS/email (one-time passcode). You will also create a display name (which could be your real name or a nickname) and you may upload an avatar image for your profile. You also select a neighborhood (e.g., Capitol Hill, Ballard, or U‑District) to associate with your profile.</p>
              <h4 className="font-medium">Profile Details</h4>
              <p>You can (optionally) add other info to your profile, like a bio or other images. Providing this info is up to you.</p>
              <h4 className="font-medium">Posts and Comments</h4>
              <p>When you write a post, share an image, or leave a comment on Seattle Pulse, we store that content. This includes any text, images, or other media that you include in a post or comment.</p>
              <h4 className="font-medium">Direct Messages</h4>
              <p>If you use the direct messaging feature to chat privately with other users, the content of those direct messages (DMs) is collected and stored. This allows the messages to be delivered and viewed by you and the recipient. Note that DMs are private between the participants, but Seattle Pulse’s systems (and authorized staff, if necessary for safety or legal reasons) have access to them.</p>
              <h4 className="font-medium">Interactions</h4>
              <p>We collect information about your interactions on the platform, such as the posts you like, repost, or if you report content or users for violating rules. (For example, we keep track of likes to show counts and ensure you can’t like something twice.)</p>

            <h3 id="sec1-2" className="text-lg font-semibold">1.2. Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
            <p>When you use Seattle Pulse, certain data gets collected automatically by our systems:</p>
            <h4 className="font-medium">Device and Usage Information</h4>
            <p>We collect data about the device and app or browser you use to access Seattle Pulse. This includes your device type (e.g., iPhone, Android phone, PC), operating system version, browser type (if on web), app version, and device identifiers (such as a device ID or a push notification token so we can send notifications). We may also collect your device’s language setting and timezone.</p>
            <h4 className="font-medium">Log Data</h4>
            <p>Our servers automatically record information (“log data”) when you use the Service. This log data may include your IP address (Internet Protocol address), which can sometimes be used to infer your general location (e.g., city or region, not your precise address). Logs also note timestamps of actions, such as when you logged in, posts you viewed, clicks or taps you make in the app, crashes and error reports, and other interactions.</p>
            <h4 className="font-medium">Cookies and Similar Tech</h4>
            <p>When you visit our website or use the app, we may use cookies (small text files stored in your browser) or local storage and similar technologies to remember information, keep you logged in, and personalize your experience (like remembering your preferences). For example, a cookie might save your session so you don’t have to re‑login every time. We do not use cookies for third‑party advertising. See Section 5 below for more on cookies.</p>
            <h4 className="font-medium">Approximate Location (Non‑GPS)</h4>
            <p>Seattle Pulse does not collect precise GPS location from your device. We may infer or ask for a coarse location such as your city or neighborhood. In fact, you directly tell us your neighborhood when signing up. If you allow, we might use your IP address or device settings to suggest a neighborhood or city, but we do not continuously track your location. Any location information is approximate (city‑level or neighborhood‑level as provided by you) and used mainly to tailor content to your local community.</p>
            <p>We do not collect sensitive personal data like your financial information, government IDs, health or biometric data, or precise geolocation, as those are not needed for Seattle Pulse’s functionality.</p>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">1.3. Information from Others</h3>
            <p>At launch, we do not receive data about you from third‑party sources such as social media networks or marketing partners. If in the future we implement an optional feature (for example, allowing you to invite friends by importing contacts, or signing in via another service), we will update this Policy to reflect any data collected from others and how we handle it.</p>
          </section>

          <article aria-labelledby="sec2">
            <h2 id="sec2" className="text-xl font-semibold">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the collected information for various purposes related to operating and improving Seattle Pulse. Here’s a breakdown of the purposes and examples:</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">To Provide the Service</h3>
            <p>We use your information to create and maintain your account, and to provide you with the features of Seattle Pulse. For example, your phone number and OTP let you log in securely; your display name and avatar represent you on the platform; your posts, comments, and messages are stored and delivered to other users as you intend.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Neighborhood Content Curation</h3>
            <p>We use your chosen neighborhood (and general location information, if provided) to show you relevant local content. For example, if you selected Capitol Hill, we’ll primarily show you posts made to the Capitol Hill community. This is core to the hyper‑local focus of our platform.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Communications and Notifications</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><span className="font-medium">Authentication and Security:</span> We send an SMS to your phone number to verify your account and for login authentication.</li>
              <li><span className="font-medium">Service Notifications:</span> We might send you administrative messages (for instance, important account alerts, changes to terms, or privacy updates), which are necessary for us to inform you of key information regarding the Service.</li>
              <li><span className="font-medium">Push Notifications &amp; Emails:</span> If you allow, we send push notifications through our app. We may also send email notifications for things like new direct messages, community updates, or feature announcements. You can control certain notification preferences as described in Section 7.</li>
              <li><span className="font-medium">Marketing and Updates:</span> We may send occasional emails about Seattle Pulse news, surveys, or promotions. Such emails will include an “unsubscribe” option and our contact information; you can opt out at any time.</li>

            <p>We use data (including posts, messages, and reports) to monitor, investigate, and enforce community standards and legal compliance. If content is reported, our team may review it (including DMs reported for abuse) to decide if it violates our rules. We also may use automated systems to detect spam or malicious behavior. If necessary, we might notify you of violations or take action like content removal or account suspension.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Service Improvement and Analytics</h3>
            <p>We use usage data and analytics to understand how users interact with the Service and to improve performance, fix bugs, and guide future development.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Advertising and Sponsored Content Delivery</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Ads may use your neighborhood or city to determine relevance (e.g., a Ballard restaurant ad appears in Ballard feeds).</li>
              <li>We might use basic demographic or interest information if you provided it; at launch, ads are contextual to neighborhoods, not individuals.</li>
              <li>We do not give your personal data to advertisers without your consent. Ad engagement metrics may be tracked in aggregate.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Compliance with Legal Obligations</h3>
            <p>We may use or disclose your information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, respond to lawful requests, or protect rights and safety.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Preventing Fraud and Technical Issues</h3>
            <p>We use data to prevent misuse, detect multiple‑account abuse, implement security features, debug errors, and protect against malicious activity.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR)</h3>

            <h3 className="font-medium">3.1. Service Providers</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><span className="font-medium">Hosting and Infrastructure:</span> AWS (U.S.) hosts our application, databases (PostgreSQL), and file storage (S3).</li>
              <li><span className="font-medium">SMS and Email Services:</span> Providers like Twilio (SMS) and email services handle delivery of OTPs and messages.</li>
              <li><span className="font-medium">Push Notification Services:</span> Apple APNS and Google/Firebase FCM use device tokens and notification content to deliver messages.</li>
              <li><span className="font-medium">Analytics or Crash Reporting (if used):</span> Tools like Sentry may collect device and event info for errors and performance.</li>
              <li><span className="font-medium">Payment Processors:</span> Apple/Google in‑app purchases or a web processor (e.g., Stripe) process payments; we don’t receive full financial data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Providers are contractually obligated to use data only to perform services for us and not for their own purposes.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">3.2. Affiliates</h3>
            <p>Information may be shared within our corporate family under privacy safeguards (at launch, Seattle Pulse is a single entity).</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">3.3. Legal Requirements and Safety</h3>
            <p>We may disclose information to comply with law, enforce our Terms, prevent fraud or technical issues, or protect rights, property, or safety. We try to notify you of legal demands when appropriate and allowed.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">3.4. Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>Information may be transferred in connection with mergers, acquisitions, investments, reorganizations, or asset sales, subject to this Policy or with notice of changes. Bankruptcy or receivership may also affect data handling.</p>

            <h3 className="font-medium">3.6. No Third‑Party Advertising Networks (at launch)</h3>
            <p>We do not share your personal information with third‑party ad networks or social media platforms for advertising at launch. Our advertising is in‑house and contextual. If this changes, we will update this Policy and provide opt‑outs.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">3.7. Your Sharing</h3>
            <p>Information you share publicly (posts, comments, public profile) is visible to others who may use or share it.

            </ul>
            <h3 className="font-medium">4.3. Managing Cookies</h3>
            <p>You can control cookies via your browser/device settings; disabling cookies may impair functionality. On mobile, similar data may be stored in local storage or device storage; clearing app data resets it.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">4.4. Do Not Track</h3>
            <p>There is no standard for DNT; since we have minimal tracking and no third‑party tracking, our practices don’t change based on DNT signals. We will update this section if our approach changes.</p>

            <p>Stored as long as accounts are active. Deleting a conversation removes it from active view; backups may persist temporarily. DMs you sent may remain in recipients’ inboxes.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Transactional and Communications Data</h3>
            <p>Support communications may be retained for record‑keeping. Typically kept a couple of years unless you request deletion and we no longer need them.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Logs</h3>
            <p>Security logs may be retained for a period (e.g., ~90 days); aggregated analytics may be kept longer, with efforts to limit or anonymize over time.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Subscription and Payment Info</h3>
            <p>Transaction records retained as needed for financial and compliance reasons.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">Legal Holds &amp; Deletion</h3>
            <p>We retain data as required by law or to enforce our rights. Upon account deletion (after any grace period), we delete or anonymize personal data, subject to backups, legal needs, and copies in other users’ content.</p>

            <p>Seattle Pulse is focused on Seattle, Washington, and systems are located in the U.S. If you use the Service from outside the U.S., your information will be transferred to and stored in the U.S.</p>
            <h3 className="font-medium">8.1. Data Transfer Mechanisms</h3>

            <p><span className="font-medium">COPPA Compliance:</span> Since our service is 13+, COPPA should not apply. If a child under 13 has an account, contact <a href="mailto:legal@seattlepulse.net" className="underline">legal@seattlepulse.net</a> so we can investigate and delete data as appropriate.</p>
